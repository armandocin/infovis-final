## Goal

The main goal of this project is to create a graphic interface starting from a real dataset. More in detail, the **open data** downloaded from the ["Regione Lazio"](https://dati.lazio.it/) web site are used as source of information.

## More About Open Data

Open Data are data freely available to everyone. They are based on the wider idea of **open government**, which allows to every citizen to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control, the informations of public administration.

Informations are available on several abstraction levels, corresponding to the hierachy of the organizational structure and politics of public administration. For example:   
- [European Open data](https://open-data.europa.eu/en/data/)
- [Italian Open data](http://www.dati.gov.it/)
- [Regione Lazio Open data](https://dati.lazio.it/)
- [Province of Rome Open data]("http://www.opendata.provincia.roma.it/)
- [Municipality of Rome Open data](http://dati.comune.roma.it/)

## The Project

The project basically takes informations about turisitic flow in region of Lazio and visualizes what's revelant in two main forms:   
- a transformable **bar chart**
- a transformable **pie chart**

aggregating the data in different ways.

### Dataset

The dataset contains the number of arrivals and attendance in tourist accommodation establishments in the provinces of Lazio. Data are grouped by destination province, origin geografic area and origin nation. The total arrivals and attendace for each of this aggregations are splitted in hotels and other establishments.  
To recap, a record of the dataset is so formed:  
  
DESTINATION PROVINCE | ORIGIN GEOGRAFIC AREA | ORIGIN NATION | HOTEL ACCOMODATIONS - ARRIVALS | HOTEL ACCOMODATIONS - ATTENDACE | OTHER ACCOMODATIONS - ARRIVALS | OTHER ACCOMODATIONS - ATTENDACE | TOTAL ACCOMODATIONS - ARRIVALS | TOTAL ACCOMODATIONS - ATTENDACE

## How to Use

Nothing more simple! Just download or clone this repository and double clic on the `index.html` file. This will be open with a browser and the project should be shown.   
If you open it with **Firefox** nothing will go wrong. Unfortunally, with new versions of **Chrome** there is a problem with the modal box. I hope to fix this soon.
